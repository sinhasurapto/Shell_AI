# Shell_AI
Perform loading of the dataset, understand the dataset dimensions, know about the columns, and create a histogram plot for the solar output.
Perform histogram plots for all the remaining columns.
Generate scatter plots to identify the relationship between various columns and solar power output.
Generate box plots for various columns to identify the outliers.
Generate the correlation map to identify columns with high correlation.
Seperate the dataset into features and labels.
Split the dataset into training and testing dataset.
Perform standard scaling of the features dataset (both training and testing).
Initialize the Machine Learning model using Linear Regression algorithm.
Train the model using the training dataset.
Evaluate the model using the testing dataset.
Evaluate again using the training dataset.
Use Streamlit library to develop and deploy a web application.
